    <h3>About me:</h3>

    <p>I'm a physiotherapy student, certified sports massage therapist, and passionate mobility coach - blending
        science, soul, and tradition in every session.
        But my story began long before formal training...
        I grew up around healing..my great-grandmother was a massage therapist and osteopath, and she passed down a deep
        belief that touch can be a powerful form of care.
        Today, I honour that legacy by helping people move better, feel stronger, and reconnect with their bodies,
        through mobility, holistic massage, and mindful recovery practices.
        Based in London, but dreaming & building something that goes beyond borders
        From Puglia's orchards to barefoot rituals to movement labs in London - bridging nature, movement, and modern
        healing.

    <h3>Testimonials:</h3>

    <strong>"It's not just therapy — it's transformation."</strong>
    <p>I booked a session for tension in my shoulders, but what i got was so much more. Alessio's energy is calm yet
        powerful. He doesn't just fix pain — he helps you reconnect with yourself. I left feeling taller, lighter, and
        somehow... renewed.
        — Giulia F., Photographer</p>
    <strong>"He made me trust my body again."</strong>
    <p>As an athlete, I've had countless massages, but Alessio's approach is on another level. He blends precision and
        intuition - one moment deep pressure, the next pure stillness. Every time, I walk out not only pain-free but
        clear-headed.
        - Tom S., Calisthenics Coach</p>
    <strong>"The only place where my mind slows down."</strong>
    <p>I went for a simple stretch session and found peace I didn't know I needed. The music, the scent, the way he
        moves around the space - everything feels intentional. This is more than a treatment - it's an experience.
        - Aisha R., Yoga Teacher
    <p>
        <strong>"He understands emotion through touch."</strong>
    <p>Sometimes you don't need to talk - Alessio just knows. He has this gift of feeling what's blocked and releasing
        it gently. After my last session, I cried - not from pain, but from relief.
        - Elena M., Wellness Coach</p>
    <strong>"Every session feels like a reset for body and soul."</strong>
    <p>I book with Alessio once a month and it's my non-negotiable ritual. My posture, sleep, and mood have all
        improved. You can tell he truly cares - it's not routine for him; it's his art.
        - Michael D., Creative Director</p>

    <h3>FAQ:</h3>
    <strong>What makes your sessions different?</strong>
    <p>Each session is completely personalised. I combine sports massage, deep stretch, and mindful touch with an
        intuitive approach - so no two treatments ever feel the same.
        It's not just about recovery; it's about reconnection.</p>
    <strong>How long are the sessions?</strong>
    <p>Sessions are available from 30 to 120 minutes, depending on what your body and schedule need most. We'll decide
        together what's right for you.</p>
    <strong>Do I need to prepare anything before coming?</strong>
    <p>Just wear something comfortable and arrive with an open mind. You don't need to do anything special — I'll guide
        you through everything.</p>
    <strong>Is it only for athletes?</strong>
    <p>Not at all. BeKindBloom experiences are for everyone - whether you train hard, sit at a desk, or simply need a
        reset. The goal is to help your body feel lighter and your mind calmer.</p>
    <strong>Where are the sessions held?</strong>
    <p>I currently work from selected wellness spaces and studios in London, and also offer private sessions upon
        request.
        Details are shared once we connect.
    <p>
        <strong>How much does it cost?</strong>
    <p>Because every person blooms differently, sessions are priced individually based on duration, frequency, and
        specific needs. This keeps things fair, accessible, and fully tailored.</p>
    <strong>Can I book regular sessions or packages?</strong>
    <p>Absolutely. Many clients choose to book regular sessions to support recovery, flexibility, or emotional balance.
        Packages are available for returning clients.</p>
    <strong>Do you offer gift cards?</strong>
    <p>Yes — you can gift someone a BeKindBloom experience, perfect for birthdays, wellness surprises, or just to say
        "you deserve a pause."</p>
